# Determinants-of-mobile-network-penetration-in-Belgaum-Karnataka-India
This project aims at studying the various levels of mobile network penetration at a household level in the district of Belgaum, Karnataka. To understand the factors that are responsible for adoption of mobile phones in a household in a village, the technique of cluster analysis has been adopted. After the formation of clusters, ordinal logistic regression was performed to find the parameters affecting the formation of clusters. After the completion of analysis, it was found that female literacy and presence of television were both important factors that made a household adopt the mobile phone technology; whereas type of construction played an important role in differentiating the various levels of clusters.
